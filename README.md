Making a web project for a schools database management system. I implemented several features including role based logins- a teacher login and a parent login, being able to add and remove students, view students details through searching, marking attendance and viewing attendance history, borrowing library books and updating lunch money through the parent portal.
for a demonstration of this, please user the following details

Teacher:
Email-john.willis@stalphonsus.edu
Password-test123

Parent:
Email-sarah.grey@email.com
Password-test123

Additionally, some validation features were added through my usage of javascript for the email and password fields.
